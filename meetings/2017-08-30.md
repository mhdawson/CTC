## Minutes

### Requesting Rod to step down or be removed from the CTC [#165](https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/issues/165)

We agreed that initial discussion would best be handled through a medium other
than email or voice discussion where it is hard to keep track of and
collaborate on options. Nikita will send out a link to a doc to TSC/CTC
members with data/initial suggestions.  It was discussed that we need to make
sure internal discussion does not stretch out too long.  This discussion will
also factor in the request in https://github.com/nodejs/board/issues/67
within the board repo.


### promises: more robust stringification [#13784](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/13784)

Bring back to GitHub for further discussion.

### stream: remove {writeableState/readableState}.length [#12857](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/12857)
### Cleanup `_writableState` and `_readableState` access across codebase [#445](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/445)

Skip these items because interested people are not present.

### drop --napi-modules earlier than dropping the "experimental" status [#9](https://github.com/nodejs/vm/issues/9)

* A PR was open: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/14902.
  Objections should be made there.

* Question is: do we remove the flag while keeping the feature experimental?
  * Jeremiah: it might be better to keep the flag if a lot of breaking
    changes are still expected.
  * Michael: There are only two planned breaking changes and we would
    remove the flag after they land.
  * Ali: removing the flag will expose the feature more to the community.
  * Left is as generally we are ok if flag is removed after any remaining
    expected breaking changes land.  Discuss/object on 
    https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/14902 it not in agreement
